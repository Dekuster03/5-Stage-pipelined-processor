# 5-Stage-pipelined-processor
This is created as a semester project for the course CSN-221(Computer architecture and microprocessor) in my BTech 2nd yr 1st semester(2022). This project design and simulates a 5 stage pipelined processor using C++.
It is written in C++ using OOP concepts and takes assembly instructions as input and displays the register and memory values along with total clock cycles taken and final CPI as output.

Sample assembly codes for Fibonacci and Factorial calculation are provided.
